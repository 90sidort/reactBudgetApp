This is a simple budget app, created to demonstrate skill in basic React, Redux, unit testing (Jest and Enzyme) and functional testing (comming soon).

To run unit tests, clone repository and use "yarn run test".

I will add some functional testing suites soon (Python Selenium and Cypress & Gherkin).

App is available in workable version on https://expensify-react-ts.herokuapp.com/
